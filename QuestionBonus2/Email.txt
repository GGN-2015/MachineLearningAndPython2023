I am writing this email to submit the assignment and ask for your review,
I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. If you have 
any questions or need any additional information, please do not hesitate 
to let me know.

The solution is attached in `Code.py` and the data is in `ALL3.txt` (which
 is not included in the email). Further DETAILS of the solution is included 
 as `README.md`. From the line chart, it can be seen that the KNN and Naive 
 Bayes algorithms have a more stable performance compared to SVM.

Thank you once again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Guannan Guo(郭冠男)
