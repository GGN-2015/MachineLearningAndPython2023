I am composing this email to submit my assignment and request 
your review of the work. I would greatly appreciate any constructive 
feedback or suggestions you may have regarding my submission. In 
case that you require any further information or have any inquiries, 
please do not hesitate to inform me.

The solution is attached in `Code.py`, further DETAILS of the 
solution is included as `README.md`. `ALL3.txt` is used as

the course.

Best regards,
