Student Name: Guannan Guo (郭冠男)
Student No. : 21200612
Subject     : [JLU-HI2023T][21200612]

This submission is very similar to the last submission of
Question 6, I only changed a little in the implementation 
of `Code.py` in order to show the error bar. If you require 
any further information or have any inquiries, please do not 
hesitate to inform me.

Thank you once again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Guannan Guo(郭冠男)

I am writing this email to submit my assignment and kindly 
request your review of the work. I would greatly appreciate 
any constructive feedback or suggestions you may have regarding 
my submission. If you require any further information or have 
any inquiries, please do not hesitate to inform me.

The solution is attached in `Code.py`, further DETAILS of the 
solution is included as `README.md`. `ALL3.txt` is used as
the input data to generate the `PrintScreen.png`, since it is 
to large to attach, it is not included in the project folder.
