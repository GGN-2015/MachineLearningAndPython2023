I am writing this email to submit the assignment and ask for your review,
I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. If you have 
any questions or need any additional information, please do not hesitate 
to let me know.

The solution is attached in `Code.py`, further DETAILS of the 
solution is included as `README.md`. `ALL3.txt` is used as
the input data to generate the `PrintScreen.png`, since it is 
too large to attach, it is not included in the project folder.

**Thank you once again for your time and consideration. In addition, I humbly 
request that I be able to see the specific scores for each assignment. If 
you have the time, I would appreciate your response.**

Best regards,
Guannan Guo(郭冠男)
