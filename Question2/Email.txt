Dear Professor Zhou,

I am writing this email to submit the assignment and ask for your 
review on the second assignment.

For the sake of maintaining consistency in the file structure, I have 
placed the descriptions of two binary classification problems in file
`README.md` . I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

I greatly appreciate your continued support and guidance throughout 
this course. Should you have any questions or require further 
information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guannan Guo (郭冠男)
