Dear Professor Zhou,

I am writing this email to submit the assignment and ask for your 
review on the second assignment.

For the sake of maintaining consistency in the file structure, I have 
placed the descriptions of two binary classification problems in file
`README.md` . I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Thank you again for your support and guidance. And if you have any 
questions or need any additional information, please do not hesitate 
to let me know.

Best regards,
Guannan Guo(郭冠男)
