Dear Professor Zhou,

Thank you very much for your suggestion. I will carefully 
consider the consistency of the article in the following 
assignments. I have made modifications to the binary 
classification problem in README.md to conform more closely 
to the definition of binary classification mentioned 
earlier in the article.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guannan Guo (郭冠男)
